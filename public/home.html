        <h5>How do the ranks work?</h5>
        <p>The ranks are calculated based on how well you do against other players in the lobby. A player getting the first place in every game will rank up very fast. There is no difference between getting 1 and 10000000 more points than the next in line.</p>

        <h5>Will mods make me rank up faster?</h5>
        <p>No. Mods are mostly preference. They affect your score according to vanilla osu! rules, so it might give you an edge, but consistency is key. Playing HDHR is more of a flex than anything. Looking at you, the 4 digits stuck in Plat.</p>

        <h5>How are the maps chosen?</h5>
        <p>They're chosen based on the average skill of the players in the lobby. To be more specific, the bot gets a "comfortable pp level" for each player based on their top 100 plays, and then gets the median value for the lobby. From then on, it simply chooses a map close to that pp level.</p>

        <h5>Why choose maps from pp instead of stars?</h5>
        <p>A level's star rating is a good indicator of whether or not you can finish the map. A level's pp rating is a good indicator of whether or not you can FC the map. There's not much point in competing on reading skills - you already know if you can or can't pass a certain star level. Competing on consistency, though? Now we're talking.</p>

        <h5>What's the map pool?</h5>
        <p>The map pool is all maps that have a leaderboard: ranked, approved and loved maps. So, about 90k maps total.</p>

        <h5>Do you use Elo for the rating algorithm?</h5>
        <p>Nope, it's <a href="https://github.com/EbTech/Elo-MMR">Elo-MMR</a>, which is better suited to multiplayer games. You can read the information given in that link for more details.</p>
