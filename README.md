# farming lobbies

1) Make "xxx pp maps (auto map select)" lobbies and log the average pp of each player.

Those lobbies must avoid maps that are already in the top10 of the 16 players. Plus avoid maps that were recently played.

2) We now know how easy it is to get pp on average, for specific maps. So not only do we have player rating, but also map rating!

We can recommend more farmable maps, and tell the players to move to easier lobbies if they're bad at farming.

### pp_db

We get beatmaps.json with a modified version of [osutools](https://github.com/chudooder/osutools), since the original json is way too big.
